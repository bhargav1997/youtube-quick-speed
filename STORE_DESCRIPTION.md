# YouTube Quick Speed - Master Your Viewing Experience

**Stop wasting time. Start watching on your terms.**

YouTube Quick Speed is the ultimate productivity tool for YouTube. It transforms how you watch videos by giving you complete control over playback speed, ads, and volume. Whether you're power-watching tutorials, skimming through daily vlogs, or trying to focus on a lecture, this extension handles the tedious parts so you can focus on the content.

### 🌟 Why You Should Install This

-  **Save Hours of Time**: Don't just skip ads—fast-forward through them instantly. Watch long videos in half the time without missing details.
-  **Eliminate Distractions**: "Zen Mode" cleans up the interface so you don't get sidetracked by clickbait on the sidebar.
-  **Learn Faster**: Use the loop tool to master complex tutorials or music riffs, and boost quiet audio to hear every whisper.

### ⚡ What It Does

**1. Nuclear Ad Control**
Ads rely on wasting your time. We give it back.

-  **Auto-Skip**: Instantly clicks "Skip Ad" the millisecond it's possible.
-  **Ad Fast-Forward**: For unskippable ads, we automatically speed them up to **16x**, turning a 30-second spot into a 2-second blip.

**2. Dynamic "Boost" Mode**
Inspired by modern short-form video apps.

-  **Hold to Speed Up**: Simply hold `Shift` (or Ctrl/Alt) to temporarily boost speed to **2x, 3x, or even 5x**.
-  **Release to Normalize**: Let go to instantly return to normal speed. Perfect for breezing through boring intros or silence.

**3. Enhanced Playback Tools**

-  **Volume Booster**: Is the video too effortless? Crank the volume up to **500%**.
-  **Precision Speed**: Set any constant speed you want (e.g., 2.5x) specifically for the video.
-  **A-B Loop**: Isolate a specific part of the video and loop it indefinitely.

### 🔒 Privacy First

You are the product on YouTube, but not here.
